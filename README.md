## Endangered Animals 
Our project is an autocomplete tool which allows users to type in a searchbox and see the latin names for endangered animals in Great Britain as they type.

When the user selects an option, they are provided with data on the animal including, its common name, habitat, endangered status, threats and conservation efforts. 

Our project uses the [ICUN red list API](http://apiv3.iucnredlist.org/)
